This crafting exercise is heavily inspired by @jh3yy post on X: https://x.com/jh3yy/status/1907979817032597689. Though not real skeumorphic design as real-world slider doesn't really look like that, still kind of fun making this 3D illusion! And yeah, don't design your birthday picker like this... ðŸ¤ª`,
