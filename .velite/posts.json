If too complex, the steep learning curve will cause many learners to give up halfway. Not just that they will never reach the end goal to complete the learning journey, also as a game, it means the loss of potential users. However, the content cannot be too simple also. We learn things best when there are \",t(o.strong,{children:\"tiny little pressures\"}),\" that push us forward, that make our brain active and attentive, and sharpen our senses and memory. If the content is too easy, the quest is too easy to complete, not only the learners will finish the course feeling that they haven't learned much, also due to the absence of challenges, the content they learned won't go into their long-term memory so deeply and they are easy to be forgotten.

The reason why we were put into a classroom setting back in school, is not just because it is easier for a teacher to teach, but also because it adds in the social element that facilitates active learning. As a learner, you will feel \",t(o.strong,{children:\"involved\"}),' in a vibrant community, where you know that \"',t(o.em,{children:'you are not alone\"'}),' in this learning journey. When you encounter a problem, there are other people who encounter the same problem as you. When you solve a problem, learn a new thing, there is a community there to cheer you up and congratulate you. Also, it acts as a \"social proof\" that testifies the knowledge that the learners acquire, as they can see how the knowledge allows other players in the game to succeed in certain quests or obtaining certain achievements. Moreover, players can share what they have achieved in the game, with their friends and family, who also act as another layer of support that drives the players forward in their learning journey.']}),\"\\n\",t(o.h2,{children:\"Conclusion\"}),\"\\n\",n(o.p,{children:[\"In conclusion, an effective \",t(o.strong,{children:\"#edtech\"}),\" game seamlessly blends the elements of \",t(o.strong,{children:\"fun and learning\"}),\", providing an engaging platform for acquiring knowledge.
