**Experimental Features** are now free to access for all users! 🎉🆓

- To access, go to **"Settings > Labs > Experimental Features"** and you will find all the experimental features that we are testing in Joodle. We will roll out more interesting and fun experiments in the future!

**Improvements & Bugfix**

- Significantly improved the performance of **Sharing** so that it is not laggy anymore.
- Also fixed a bug causing **animated doodle sharing** stroke color to stay at one color even if user updates the color scheme.
- Now if your preferred color scheme is **System**, the **Share Sheet** will open with the matching color scheme instead of always being in light mode.
