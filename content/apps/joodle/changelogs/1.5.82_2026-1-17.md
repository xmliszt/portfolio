- Introduced note prompt: after you complete a doodle, the app will prompt you to add an optional note. You can turn off this in "Settings > Customization".
- We have switched from Discord Community to **WhatsApp Community** as the latter is more widely used and supported. You can [join the WhatsApp Community here](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FF2rMEiSOwe9hsRapSyvdY). Or in "Settings > Get Involved > Join WhatsApp Community"
- Changelog view will now show a banner to download the latest update if your current version is not the latest.

**Improvements & Bugfix**

- Removed GIF as a sharing option as some social media platforms do not support it. You can share animated Joodle entries as videos.
- Improved the entry editing experience.
- We updated our [Privacy Policy](https://liyuxuan.dev/apps/joodle/privacy-policy)!
