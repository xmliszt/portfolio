**What's New**

- Animated Joodle: now your doodles are animated when you first open them
  Improvements & Bugfix
- Added additional top snapping position for vertical split view. At the highest split position, your doodle is enlarged for you to have a better look at it. You will have more space to write your notes as well!
- In "Normal" view mode (vs "Minimized"), each row is exactly 7 days of entries, and the entries are layout based on actual calendar with first column matching "Start of Week", which you can configure in "Settings" for Sunday or Monday as the Start of Week.
- Settings page now has a more consistent and refreshed look! All the things you need are still there, just in a more organized way 😌
- Added more tutorials.
