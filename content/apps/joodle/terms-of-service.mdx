## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the Joodle mobile application ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.

## 2. Description of Service

Joodle is a private journaling application that allows users to create, store, and manage personal journal entries, drawings, and photos on their own devices.

Joodle is designed to be an offline-first, personal tool. We do not operate servers that store user content.

## 3. Privacy-First Design

Joodle is built with privacy as a core principle:

- We do **not collect** personal information, usage data, analytics, or identifiers
- We do **not access, monitor, analyze, or use** your content
- All content remains on your device and/or your personal iCloud account (if enabled)

Your data belongs entirely to you.

## 4. User Responsibilities

You agree to:

- Use the App in compliance with applicable laws
- Maintain the security of your device and Apple ID
- Understand that you are solely responsible for the content you create and store using the App
- Maintain your own backups of important data

We do not moderate or review user content, as we do not have access to it.

## 5. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property rights in the App itself—including software, design, graphics, and trademarks—are owned by us or our licensors.

You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.

This license does **not** grant us any rights to your content.

## 6. User Content

You retain full ownership of all content you create using the App ("User Content").

By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that:

- User Content is stored locally on your device
- We do not access or process User Content
- We cannot recover lost or deleted User Content
- You are responsible for managing and backing up your data

## 7. iCloud Sync (Optional Feature)

If you enable iCloud sync:

- Your User Content is stored in your private iCloud container
- Data handling is governed by Apple’s iCloud Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- We do not operate, control, or access iCloud services or stored data
- Sync availability and reliability depend on Apple’s services

## 8. No Warranty

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, RESULTING FROM:

- USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP
- DATA LOSS DUE TO DEVICE FAILURE, OS ISSUES, OR USER ACTION
- THIRD-PARTY SERVICES SUCH AS ICLOUD
- UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE OR APP DATA

## 10. Termination

You may stop using the App at any time.

We reserve the right to discontinue or modify the App at any time without liability. Since no accounts or stored data are maintained by us, termination does not affect your local data.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## 13. Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising from these Terms or the App shall first be attempted to be resolved through good-faith discussion. If unresolved, disputes shall be handled in Singapore in accordance with applicable law.

## 14. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

## 15. Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App and supersede any prior agreements.
