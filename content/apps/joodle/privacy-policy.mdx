## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Joodle ("we", "our", or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Joodle mobile application (the "App").

If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.

## 2. Information We Collect

**None.**

Joodle does not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal information, usage data, analytics, or identifiers from its users.

Joodle is designed as a private, offline-first journaling app.

## 3. Data Stored on Your Device

All journal entries, drawings, photos, and other content you create in Joodle are stored locally on your device. This data remains under your control at all times.

We do not have access to this data.

## 4. iCloud Sync (Optional)

If you choose to enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in your **private iCloud container** associated with your Apple ID.

- Data is encrypted and managed by Apple
- Only you can access this data
- We do not operate any servers that store your content
- We do not have access to your iCloud data

Please refer to Apple’s Privacy Policy for details on how iCloud data is handled.

## 5. Use of Information

Because we do not collect any personal information, we do not use your data for analytics, advertising, tracking, or any other purpose beyond providing the App’s functionality on your device.

## 6. Disclosure of Information

We do not sell, trade, rent, or share personal information with third parties, as we do not collect it.

## 7. Third-Party Services

Joodle does not integrate with third-party services, analytics providers, advertising networks, or external databases.

## 8. Security

Your data remains on your device and/or within your personal iCloud account. While we take care to design the App securely, no method of electronic storage is completely secure. You are responsible for securing access to your device and Apple ID.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

Joodle does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected, we do not store information related to age or identity.

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
