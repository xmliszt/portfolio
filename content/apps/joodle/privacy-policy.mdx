## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Joodle ("we", "our", or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Joodle mobile application (the "App").

If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Analytics Data

Joodle uses **PostHog**, a privacy-focused analytics platform, to collect anonymous usage data. This helps us understand how the App is used and improve the user experience.

**What we collect:**

- **App lifecycle events**: When the app is launched, becomes active, or enters the background
- **User interactions**: Button taps, toggle changes, navigation actions, and gestures (such as scrubbing)

- **Onboarding and tutorial progress**: Steps viewed, completed, or skipped during onboarding and tutorials
- **Screen views**: Which screens you visit within the App
- **Subscription events**: Paywall views, subscription starts, restores, and purchase metadata (product ID, trial status, offer code usage — no payment details or financial information is collected)
- **Settings changes**: When settings are modified (setting names and values, not personal content)
- **Share feature usage**: When you use the share card feature (style and format preferences)

This data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally.

- Analyze onboarding effectiveness
- Make informed product decisions

We do **not** use your data for advertising, tracking across apps, or selling to third parties.

## 7. Third-Party Services

Joodle integrates with the following third-party service:

Joodle does not integrate with advertising networks or external databases that store your personal content.

## 8. Security

Your journal content remains on your device and/or within your personal iCloud account. Analytics data transmitted to PostHog is encrypted in transit.

While we take care to design the App securely, no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure. You are responsible for securing access to your device and Apple ID.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Joodle does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The analytics data we collect is anonymous and does not include any information related to age or identity.

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
