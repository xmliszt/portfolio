**If your anniversary alarms aren't working, check these settings**:

1. **System notifications must be enabled**:
   • Go to **Settings** (iOS) → **Notifications** → **Joodle**.
   • Make sure **Allow Notifications** is turned ON.
   • Ensure **Lock Screen**, **Notification Center**, and **Banners** are enabled.

2. **Focus Mode may be blocking notifications**:
   • Check if Do Not Disturb or a Focus mode is active.
   • Add Joodle to your Focus mode's allowed apps if needed.

3. **Notification permission was denied**:
   • If you denied permission when first asked, you need to enable it manually in iOS Settings.

**To re-enable notifications**:

1. Open the **Settings app** on your device.
2. Scroll down and tap **Joodle**.
3. Tap **Notifications**.
4. Toggle **Allow Notifications** ON.
