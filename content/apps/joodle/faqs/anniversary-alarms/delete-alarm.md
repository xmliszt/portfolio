**To remove an anniversary alarm**:

1. Navigate to the day entry with the alarm.
2. Tap the **alarm icon** in the header on top left corner.
3. You'll see your existing alarm.
4. Tap **Clear** on the top right corner.

The alarm will be removed and you won't receive notifications for that date anymore.

**Note**: Deleting a alarm doesn't delete the Joodle itself - your drawing and notes remain safe. If you delete the Joodle, any existing alarm will also be removed.

**Alternatively**:

1. Navigate to "Settings > General Anniversary Alarms".
2. You will see all your anniversary alarms listed.
3. You can remove an alarm simply by swiping left on the row.
4. Or you can tap "Edit" on top right corner to delete multiple alarms at once.
