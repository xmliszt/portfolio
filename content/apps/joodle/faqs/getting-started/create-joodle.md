**Creating a Joodle is simple**:

1. Open the app - you'll see the grid view.
2. Tap on any day (dot) to select an entry.
3. Tap the **scribble icon** on top right corner to open the drawing canvas.
4. Draw your doodle using your finger.
5. Tap **tick** to save.
6. For entry with existing doodle, you can tap the doodle itself to open the canvas.

You can also add text notes to any day by tapping the selected day and typing in the text field.

**Tip**: Try the scrubbing gesture! Press and hold on the grid, then drag your finger across days to quickly browse through your entries.
