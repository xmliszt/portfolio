**Scrubbing is a quick way to browse your Joodles with haptic feedback**:

1. Press and hold down on any day entry on the grid.
2. Keep your finger pressed and drag across the dots.
3. As you move, you'll see a preview of each day's Joodle in the top header.
4. You will feel a haptic feedback as you scrub, if you have haptic enabled.
5. Release your finger to select that day.

This gesture lets you quickly scan through an entire year of entries without tapping each day individually.

**Tip**: Haptic feedback helps you feel when you move to a new day. You can toggle haptics on/off in Settings → General → Interactions.
