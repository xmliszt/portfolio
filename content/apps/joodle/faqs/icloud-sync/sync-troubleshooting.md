title: My Joodles aren't syncing across devices
order: 1
---

**If your Joodles aren't appearing on other devices, try these steps**:

1. **Check your subscription** - iCloud Sync requires Joodle Pro.
2. **Verify iCloud is enabled** - Go to device Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Saved to iCloud → Joodle must be ON.
3. **Check network connection** - Sync requires an active internet connection.
4. **Same Apple ID** - Ensure all devices are signed into the same iCloud account.
5. **Allow time** - iCloud sync may take a few minutes to propagate changes.
6. **Restart the app** - Sometimes a fresh start helps.

**If sync was working before but stopped**:

Try signing out of iCloud on all devices, signing back in, and reopening Joodle.

**Note**: Joodle cannot control when Apple's iCloud servers sync data. If you've just made changes, please allow a few minutes for them to appear on other devices.
