**If you have iCloud Sync enabled**: Your Joodles are safely stored in iCloud and will automatically download when you reinstall the app and sign into the same iCloud account.

**If you don't have iCloud Sync enabled**: Your Joodles are stored only on your device. Reinstalling the app will delete your data unless you create a backup first.

**To create a backup**:

1. Go to **Settings** in Joodle.
2. Tap **General → Backup & Restore**.
3. Tap **Backup Locally**.
4. Save the backup file to a safe location.

You can restore from this backup using the **Restore From Local Backup** option after reinstalling.
