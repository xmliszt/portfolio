**To enable iCloud Sync, you need to**:

1. Subscribe to **Joodle Pro** (iCloud Sync is a premium feature).
2. Make sure you're signed into iCloud on your device.
3. Enable iCloud for Joodle in your device's **Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Saved to iCloud → Joodle**.
4. Enable sync in the Joodle app under **Settings → General → iCloud Sync**.

**Important**: Both the system iCloud toggle and the in-app toggle must be enabled for sync to work.

After enabling sync, you may need to restart the app for changes to take effect.
