**iCloud Sync is free for all users!** To enable it:

1. Make sure you're signed into iCloud on your device.
2. Enable iCloud for Joodle in your device's **Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Saved to iCloud → Joodle**.
3. Enable sync in the Joodle app under **Settings → General → iCloud Sync**.

**Important**: Both the system iCloud toggle and the in-app toggle must be enabled for sync to work.

After enabling sync, you may need to restart the app for changes to take effect.
