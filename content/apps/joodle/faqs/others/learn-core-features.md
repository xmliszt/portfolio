title: How do I learn how to use Joodle or revisit onboarding?
order: 2

Joodle offers interactive tutorials to help you master the app's core features at your own pace.

**To access interactive tutorials:**

1. Go to **Settings > Need Help? > Learn Core Features**
2. Browse the list of available interactive tutorials
3. Tap on any tutorial to start learning that feature

Each tutorial will guide you through a specific part of Joodle with hands-on practice.

**Revisiting Onboarding:**

At the bottom of the Learn Core Features screen, you can choose to revisit the onboarding experience if you missed it initially or want a refresher.

⚠️ **Important Note:** Revisiting onboarding will overwrite today's Joodle entry and take you through the preference setup again. Make sure you're okay with this before proceeding.
