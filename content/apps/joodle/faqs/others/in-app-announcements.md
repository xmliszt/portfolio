Joodle can send you custom announcements to keep you informed about updates, offers, and community news. You can manage your announcement preferences via **Settings > General > Announcements**.

**Main Switch**

- **Enable Announcements**: Toggle this off to disable all announcements. When on, you will receive announcements based on your individual preferences below.

**Individual Announcement Types**

You can toggle each announcement type on or off:

- **Promotions**: Special offers and promotions
- **Community**: Discord, events, and community updates
- **Tips & Tutorials**: App tips and tutorials

Only the announcement types you have enabled will be delivered to you.
