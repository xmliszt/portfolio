**If your widget shows outdated content, try these steps**:

1. **Open the Joodle app** - Widgets update when the app is opened.
2. **Wait a few minutes** - iOS updates widgets periodically, not instantly.
3. **Check Background App Refresh** - Go to Settings → General → Background App Refresh and make sure it is enabled for Joodle.
4. **Restart your device** - Restarting your iPhone can help refresh widget timelines.
5. **Remove and re-add** - Long press the widget → Remove Widget, then add it again.

**How widget updates work**:

- Widgets refresh automatically when you open Joodle.
- iOS manages widget refresh timing to save battery.
- The Random Doodle widget shows a different Joodle each day.
- Different widget sizes may show different random selections.

**Known issue**: iOS limits how often widgets can refresh. This is an Apple limitation to preserve battery life. This is a known issue on iOS 26, and a full fix is still pending from Apple.
