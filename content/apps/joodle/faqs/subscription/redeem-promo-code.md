**To redeem a promo code, follow these steps:**

1. Open the Joodle app on your device.
2. Navigate to the "Settings" page.
3. On very top, you should see the subscription section with "Joodle Pro". Tap on the "Redeem Promo Code" option below.
4. Enter the promo code in the provided field.
5. Tap "Continue" to apply the code and follow the instructions.

**Note**: Promo code is a one-time use code that can be redeemed only once. Some codes have add-on effect on top of existing introductory offer like free trials, so your subscription period may be extended. Cancel subscription while applying a promo code may result in the loss of current Joodle Pro subscription immediately depending on Apple's policies.
