**The general details about the billing timelines are as follows**:

- You can subscribe to a yearly plan (billed once a year), and a monthly plan (billed once a month). The availability and pricing of subscription plans may vary.
- The payment will be charged to your Apple ID Account when you confirm the purchase.
- The subscription automatically renews for the same price and duration period as the original one monthly/yearly plan, unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
- Free trial automatically converts to a paid subscription, unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the trial period. From that point onwards, subscription automatically renews, unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
