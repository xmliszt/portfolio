## What is the focus?

This month, I'm focusing on [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/). I never properly learned Figma before. So this time, I want to use a project to learn Figma. I am gonna design a "Dune" themed light and dark mode switcher. And then I will implement it with NextJS and [**Frame Motion**](https://www.framer.com/motion/). So this week's focus, actually I will continue learn about Frame Motion as well.

## Progress tracker

- [ ] Continue learn about Frame Motion.
- [ ] Design a "Dune" themed light and dark mode switcher with Figma.
- [ ] Implement the design with NextJS and Frame Motion, see it live on this portfolio site.
