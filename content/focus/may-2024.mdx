## What is the focus?

For this month, I decided to give myself a mental reset. So I will not focus on a particular thing to study. Instead, I will just jot down any interesting discoveries that I encounter. Last month was quite an intense month for me, including participating in the [Supabase Open Source Hackathon 2024](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-oss-hackathon) in which my next EdTech project [Convo](https://convo.website) was born. I would like to take this opportunity to catch my breath, do some readings, and perhaps think about what is next for [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.com) and [Convo](https://convo.website) and potentially more EdTech projects to come!
