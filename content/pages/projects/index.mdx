## CB2.0 (COVID-19 themed)

A Unity group project I did with three other friends back in uni as the final project of our game development course. The game is a **COVID-19 themed** 2D platformer which supports up to 4 players. There are in total four mini-games for selection, each game is created with a different theme and mechanics, revolving around the concept of **swab test**, **social distancing** and **fighting for toilet paper** and **crowd control**. The game is designed to be played with friends, and it's a lot of fun to play together as a party game! Unfortunately, we haven't published the game on Steam yet, so you can visit our GitHub repository to download and build it yourself using Unity engine.
