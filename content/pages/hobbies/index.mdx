I have many hobbies.

## Music composition ðŸŽ¹

I like to write my emotions and stories into music. I think this is a great way to store memories and feelings. I have a MIDI keyboard, a guitar, and a microphone. I previously used **Fl Studio 12**, and then switch to **GarageBand** because it is free. And now I'm using **Logic Pro X** as it provides more comprehensive features.

I do have a YouTube channel where I upload my music. You can check it out [here](https://youtube.com/@bbfishstudio8837)! When I have completed a piece of music, I will use **Adobe Audition** to mix and master it. I also use **Adobe After Effects** to create the PV for my music, mostly just a simple visualizer with some effects. I will carefully choose the background image so that it matches the mood of the music and how I feel when I wrote it.
