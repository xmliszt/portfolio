```tsx title="hover-button.tsx"
import React from 'react';

export const HoverButton = () => {
  const [hover, setHover] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <button
      onMouseEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setHover(false)}
      style={{
        backgroundColor: hover ? 'blue' : 'red',
      }}
    >
      Hover me
