Hey there, lovely people of the internet! 🌟 I'm Li Yuxuan, but you can call me YX for short (Sorry my name is kind of hard to pronounce in English🙇🏻‍♂️). Picture this: a blend of Chinese roots with a sprinkle of Singaporean spirit – that's me! I've been on this sunny island since I was 15, and let me tell you, Singapore feels like a second home now.

By day, I'm diving deep into the world of software engineering, crafting digital wonders with a focus on web development. I'm currently working in [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com) as a Software Engineer, working on an internal tool that aims to bridge between designs and AI🤫. From coding to creating, I'm currently focusing all about making user experiences sing with beauty and functionality, and constantly learning about the ever-evolving massive world of software engineering out there. Think smooth interfaces and apps that just get you – that's the dream I'm chasing!

But wait, there's more! Teaching is my jam too. I've got this knack for turning learning into an adventure, whether it's through coding tutorials or sharing my love for music theory. I think I am pretty good at turning knowledge into effective learning adventures for students. One of my secret weapons is to always use real-world relatable examples (if it is something the student can personally relate to, it is even better!) when teaching a complicated concept so that my students can understand more easily.

Speaking of which, did I mention my musical escapades? Piano, violin, guitar – you name it, I've dabbled in it. And let's not forget my fascination with Ghibli films and their enchanting soundtracks. (Thank you so much Hayao Miyazaki and Joe Hisaishi 🙏🏻❤️). If you catch me lost in thought, I'm probably composing my own melodies or whipping up some magical graphics to go with them. And why stopping here if I can create music myself? So I tried out music composition with my MIDI keyboards and softwares, made [quite a few pieces](https://youtube.com/@bbfishstudio8837) over the years, and learnt not just music creation, but also audio and video graphic editings along the way as well!

Now, let's switch gears a bit. While I'm not exactly a marathon enthusiast (running? Nah, not my scene), give me a pool, a bike, or a pair of rollerblades, and I'm in my element. There's something liberating about cruising through the city, soaking in the sights, and stumbling upon hidden gems along the way.

Oh, and did I mention books? I'm a bit of a bookworm too. From thought-provoking reads to whimsical tales, my bookshelf (a digital one 👀) is always brimming with stories waiting to be discovered.

So, there you have it – a glimpse into my eclectic world of code, creativity, and curiosity. Feel free to wander through my digital playground here and [drop me a line](/contacts) if you fancy a chat. Let's make some magic happen together!

Catch you on the flip side,
Yuxuan 😉

嘿朋友们！🌟 我是李雨轩。我在中国福建厦门长大，但从15岁起，我就在新加坡这个阳光明媚的岛屿上生活到现在，新加坡已经成为了我的第二家园。

白天，我身处软件工程的世界，专注于网页开发。目前我在[Mobbin](https://mobbin.com)担任一名软件工程师，参与开发一个旨在连接人工智能与设计的内部工具🤫。从编码到创作，我把我的重心完全放在打造既美观又功能强大的用户体验上，同时不断探索着日新月异的软件工程世界。想象一下流畅的界面和让人心领神会的应用——这正是我追求的梦想！

此外，教学也是我的一大爱好。我擅长将学习变成一次冒险，无论是通过编程教程还是分享我对音乐理论的热爱。我觉得我在将知识转化为有效的学习内容方面做得还可以哈哈。我的一个小诀窍：就是始终使用与现实生活息息相关的例子（如果学生能够与之产生共鸣，那就更好！）来教授复杂的概念，以便让我的学生更容易理解。

说到音乐，我的生活真的不能没有音乐。钢琴、小提琴、吉他，这些我都尝试过。还有，我是忠实的吉卜力电影粉，痴迷于宫崎骏爷爷和久石让爷爷极力打造的一个奇幻美好、单纯安静的世界（感谢宫崎骏和久石让🙏🏻❤️）。如果你看到我陷入沉思，那么我可能正在创作自己的旋律，或者正在脑补一些能够将音乐和我的本意表达出来的图像和动画吧。在过去这些年里，我也尝试了用我的 MIDI 键盘和软件进行音乐创作，多年来创作了[不少作品](https://youtube.com/@bbfishstudio8837)，并且在这个过程中不仅学会了音乐创作，还学会了音频和视频以及图像的编辑。

我不是马拉松爱好者（跑步绝对不是我的菜），我更喜欢游泳、骑车或者滑旱冰。在城市中自由驰骋，享受风景，发现隐藏宝藏，看看身边发生的各种小小的生活碎片，这种感觉让我心旷神怡。

哦，对了，我时不时也看一些书籍，从发人深省的阅读到诙谐幽默的故事，我的书架（一本电纸书👀）充满了等待被发现的故事。

所以，这就是我多元化的代码、创造力和好奇心世界的一瞥。这里是我搭建的一个数字游乐场，如果你感兴趣，可以停下繁忙的脚步，看一看瞧一瞧，如果有什么想要和我聊聊，也欢迎[给我留言](/contacts)。让我们一起制造一些有魔力的东西吧！

不见不散！
雨轩 😉
