## Introduction

This week, let's delve into **how we can enhance our memory retention**. Drawing from Chapter 4, "How Do We Remember," in Julie Dirksen's book [Design for How People Learn (Voices That Matter)](https://www.amazon.com/Design-People-Learn-Voices-Matter/dp/0134211286), I aim to distill the key takeaways for you in this blog post. To begin, we'll explore the various types of memory. Next, we will explore the processes that can aid in **improving memorisation**. Let's get started!

## Types of Memory

**Sensory Memory** is the briefest form, lasting only a few milliseconds to seconds. It's acquired through our senses like smell, sight, hearing, taste, and touch. Notably, elements that capture our attention here move on to our short-term memory.

**Short-Term Memory** lasts about 15-30 seconds without repetition. It's the memory we employ to handle immediate tasks, like when your boss urgently assigns a task. Neglecting to jot it down or rehearse it in your mind may lead to forgetting. It's also crucial in problem-solving scenarios, where rapid assimilation of information is key.

**Long-Term Memory** has the potential for limitless duration, spanning minutes, hours, or even a lifetime. There are many types of Long-Term Memory: **Declarative or Semantic Memory**, **Episodic Memory**, **Conditioned Memory**, **Procedural Memory**, and **Flashbulb Memory**. Here I won't be explaining each one as their definitions can be easily found online. Instead, I will tell you about my thoughts on how we can leverage the technology around us to gather these types of memory easier.

## The Power of Knowledge Association

**Declarative or Semantic Memory** encompasses our general knowledge, facts, and concepts. This space in our brain provides ample room for creating **knowledge associations** between different pieces of information. For instance, when teaching Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, I found that using real-life scenarios helped my student make connections. By associating the encapsulation concept with the familiar operation of a car's controls, the student grasped the idea more effectively.

"So when you are driving a car," I told the student, "the buttons on your steering wheel, you know exactly how to use them and each one does what functionality, right? However, if I ask you behind the scenes what happens when you pull the latch for the left turn signal, you probably wouldn't know, right? So this is encapsulation. It covers up the internal logics on how things are done and just presents to you an interface where you, as a client or user, can easily interact with and achieve the expected outcome. And this is what a class does in OOP programming."

After the story of the car steering wheel (and dashboard), my student was able to place the OOP concept into his long-term memory, and he actually performed better when trying to use a programming language to code it out, because he was very familiar with the concepts already.

This **power of knowledge association** applies not only when learning but also when teaching. By **linking new knowledge with existing understanding**, we enhance the likelihood of retention in long-term memory.

## The Power of Immersive Experience

Imagine learning about a historical event. You could study it from a book at home, or you could immerse yourself in the country, visit local museums, and experience the event on-site. Which approach do you think would be more effective?

We learn best when we **engage all our senses**. This multi-sensory experience, involving sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch, creates a lasting impression, as this is **how our brain naturally processes and retains information**. Moreover, the real-life experiences allow us to utilise the **Episodic Memory** portion, that help us associate specific events in our life with the new knowledge and information. This is why someone immersed in a foreign country often learns the language faster.

Consider the process of teaching a child the word "Apple." Rather than resorting to rote memorisation through repetitive spelling, why not offer the child a real apple? By engaging their senses—feeling the smooth surface, inhaling the distinct scent, and tasting the sweet flavour—the child forms a rich sensory association with the word "Apple." This multi-sensory experience creates a lasting impression in their memory. When information transforms from static text to a **dynamic, tangible experience**, it is more likely to be retained in long-term memory.

Furthermore, with the AI technology nowadays, it is even more effortless to create such immersive experience for the learners. We can give the AI a series of words to learn for this week's vocabulary, and **ask AI to link up each word to come up with a thrilling story with pictures and even audio**! How fun will the learning experience be for the students!

## Conclusion

In this blog, I've explored two powerful methods for enhancing long-term memory: **knowledge association** and **immersive experience**. By connecting new information with what we already know and engaging all our senses, we can significantly improve retention. With advancing technology, **personalised learning experiences tailored to individual knowledge and immersive scenarios** may revolutionise education in the future! For now, we still have a long way to go and there is definitely a bright future waiting for us in the education industry!
