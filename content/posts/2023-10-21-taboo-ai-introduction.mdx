Enter [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app): an innovative online game that not only tests your English proficiency but also challenges you to outsmart an Artificial Intelligence opponent. **The premise is simple: you'll receive three "taboo words" that you must coax the AI into saying, all without actually uttering those words or their associated terms.** It's a linguistic dance where creativity and strategy reign supreme.

### Collaborative Topic Contribution Worldwide

[Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app) is a collaborative endeavor, welcoming contributions from the community. Topics are rich and varied, each featuring at least three taboo words, with some even delving into the realms of complex scientific jargon. This means you'll need to flex those mental muscles and craft your descriptions with precision and flair.

### Carefully Designed Scoring System

**In [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app), it's not about how quickly you finish, but about the quality of your conversation.** The scoring system prioritizes creativity, descriptiveness, and the breadth of your knowledge over speed. This ensures that players focus on producing grammatically correct English expressions, rather than resorting to tricks or cheats to coax out the coveted "Taboo word."

### Expansive AI Mode with Unlimited Topics

**Don't find a topic that piques your interest? No problem.** "AI Mode" has got you covered. Simply input a topic you'd like to explore, and watch as the AI generates a brand-new game with taboo words related to your chosen subject. This means the possibilities with [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app) are virtually boundless. Say goodbye to limitations imposed by predefined topics, and say hello to endless learning and fun!

**In [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app), creativity isn't just encouraged; it's essential.** As you strive to describe words without mentioning them directly, you'll tap into your wellspring of creativity. Rephrasing and maneuvering around restricted words becomes second nature, pushing your linguistic boundaries. Plus, with grammar and sentence structure forming part of the scoring criteria, you're bound to refine your language skills.

### Conversational Practice and Long-Term Memory

Engaging with ChatGPT, a highly proficient language model, provides a unique opportunity to practice with a "professional English AI speaker." There's no fear of judgment for imperfect grammar or sentence structureâ€”just pure, enjoyable learning!

## Conclusion

So, why wait? Dive in, challenge your linguistic prowess, and watch as your English proficiency soars to new heights!

## Future of Taboo AI

And the English improvement journey does not stop here! [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app) is constantly maintained and improved by me and I'm deeply passionate to add more features to make this game even better. Here are a few things that you can expect for the upcoming releases:

### Scoring System with Feedbacks

Currently, you will see AI judge's feedback on the quality of your conversation. However, the current AI only tells you **what is lacking**, but does not have the ability to tell you **how to improve it**. If you made a grammar mistake, the AI is not able to tell you how to write it in a correct way; but in the future, it will!

### Personal Profile and Flashcard System

Ok, this is a big update. For any sign-in user, you will enjoy a personal space in [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app) where you can see your past results, manage vocabularies you have played with, and creating flashcards with them and practice them! [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app) will give you a unique flashcard practice experience that you will never see elsewhere, utilizing its existing conversation model.

### Situational Conversation with More Fun Engagement

Speaking about immersive conversation with scenarios, which is a great way to practice English, I want to incorporate this into [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app) as well. For preimum players in the future, [Taboo AI](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app) might roll out curated situational conversation mode, where you can play the Game of Taboo, but at the same time, in a specific situational setting (e.g. Boarding an airplane, Ordering a meal, etc.). This is to really leverage on the immersive part of the experience, to make you feel that you are talking to a real person on a particular situation. I hope with these features, your English journey can be greatly enriched and improved!
